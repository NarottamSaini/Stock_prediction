# Recurrent Neural Network

# Importing a data -> Selecting data/cols for training
# training data feature scaling
# Creata a list with each index having list of 60 values and o/p with one value (X_train, y_train)
# Convert them into a array
# Reshaping them into format required by RNN

# building a RNN network
# initializing RNN
# adding a hidden layers
# Compiling a RNN
# fitting RNN for training on train set

# import the test_data set -> selecting a req. column from a main dataframe
# creating a 'input' variable from df which will take last 60 values from training set from which it will predict first value of o/p
# reshape and transform the variable

# prepare the x_test with last 60 value of x_train 
# np.array, reshape 
# using .predict for predicting
